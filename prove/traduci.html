        <h1>Creating Microsoft Azure Web Sites</h1>
        <p>
            Microsoft Azure supports several ways to create web sites. Of the
            available Microsoft Azure offerings, Cloud Services and Virtual Machines
            are the most flexible. While both of these approaches allow a great deal
            of control over your environment, they also require skill and time. A
            more streamlined experience is available with Microsoft Azure Web Sites.
            For web applications written by using ASP.NET, Node.js, PHP, or Python,
            Microsoft Azure Web Sites enables rapid deployment, easy configuration,
            monitoring, high scalability, and a service level agreement (SLA). This
            paper provides guidance on using Microsoft Azure Web Sites. Creating a
            web site from the gallery You can easily create a new Microsoft Azure
            web site by selecting a starter project from the gallery in the
            Microsoft Azure Management Portal. These options provide solutions to
            get you closer to your goal with less work than if you started with a
            blank project. The gallery contains Microsoft-provided options, such as
            ASP.NET-related starter projects, as well as options for Python, PHP,
            and Node.js that are based on community projects or from other third
            parties. This paper assumes that you already have a Microsoft Azure
            subscription. (If you do not have an account, sign up for a free
            one-month trial of Microsoft Azure.) After logging into your account on
            the Management Portal, you will see a window similar to the image in
            Figure 1.

        <p>
            Since the subdomain we chose for our web site is “scientificwebsite,”
            the web site will be created at
            http://scientificwebsite.azurewebsites.net, or at the equivalent HTTPS
            URL by using the built-in wildcard SSL support. 7. Click the name of the
            web site, scientificwebsite, to get to the next screen.

            In this screen (Figure 6), you can that see we have selected our web
            site (1); our web site name displays at the top (2). Relating
            specifically to our web site, we are on the DASHBOARD tab (3), which has
            a lot of useful information, including a summary of the monitoring data
            (4), and the ability to view and make changes to various credentials for
            FTP, management through the API, and more (5). In addition to the
            DASHBOARD tab, there are other tabs where you can configure specialized
            settings. For example, from the SCALE tab, you can manage manual scaling
            and configure auto-scaling rules, and the CONFIGURE tab provides options
            for logging parameters, configuring a custom domain name, and more.

        <h2>Creating Microsoft Azure Web Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Initial creation of Python web sites and using third-party tools The
            simplest way to start configuring a Python web site is to select an
            option from the gallery. This ensures that proper site configuration is
            in place and that the Python libraries (for example, Django) are
            deployed for the web site. Once deployed, you can use FTP to capture the
            source code from the site and copy it locally. Once the source is local,
            you can edit with any tool (such as Vim, PyCharm, or Microsoft Visual
            Studio). Alternatively, if you would like to start a project from within
            another tool, you can set up Python configuration settings yourself. In
            addition to configuration settings, deployments must include all
            non-standard Python libraries needed by your web site, such as all the
            libraries you downloaded by using pip or a similar package manager. For
            instructions on setting up Python configuration settings and deploying
            additional Python libraries, see the tutorial, Creating Web Sites with
            Django. Automatic publishing to web sites Web Sites supports integration
            with a number of source code repositories, such as Bitbucket, GitHub,
            and VisualStudio.com, and even other services, such as Dropbox. You can
            configure any of these so that changes to source code deploy
            automatically to one or more web sites. In this section, you will learn
            how to configure a web site to support continuous deployment from a
            GitHub repository. Continuous deployment means that if there is a
            change, the web site updates automatically. If someone uses the commands
            git commit and then git push to record changes to the repository, GitHub
            executes a WebHook. A WebHook allows a repository to communicate with a
            web server whenever the repository receives a push. In this example, the
            WebHook communicates with the Microsoft Azure web site, which performs a
            git pull and redeploys the code. For more information about WebHooks,
            see Creating Webhooks on GitHub Help. Aside from the advantage of
            keeping your web site updated, there are additional benefits associated
            with continuous deployment. For example, if you don't want to give
            people access to your web server, you can give them access to the GitHub
            repository instead and they can check in their changes there. If you
            want to review changes before they appear on the web site, you can use
            the git pull feature (commonly known as a “pull request”). The next
            section is a procedure for creating the web site by using existing code.
            It assumes that you already have a GitHub account with a repository (in
            addition to your Microsoft Azure subscription). Your repository should
            contain some code that can appear on your web site, such as a "Hello,
            word" example. If you would like, you can also clone the flasky GitHub
            repository that is in this example.

        <p>You will see that a new WebHook URL has been added (displayed in the second URL field in Figure 13), which is
            attached to the flaskdemo web site. Managing and scaling web sites The Microsoft Azure Web Sites service
            offers plans that target various common workloads. For lowvolume web sites, there is a free plan that
            includes a modest amount of traffic and some space in either MySQL or Microsoft Azure SQL Database. For
            higher-traffic and more complex web applications, there are paid options that support custom domain names,
            auto-scaling, and the ability to scale between 1 and 40 CPU cores. For more information about pricing, see
            Microsoft Azure pricing at-a-glance. Full management of web sites is available through the Microsoft Azure
            Management Portal, but there are also management APIs to enable integration with other tools. The APIs can
            be accessed natively through REST-style integration, but there are also platform-specific SDKs written for
            Node.js, Python, .NET (for C#, F#, or any other .NET Framework programming language), Java, popular mobile
            platforms, and others (see the full list). Microsoft also exposes management features through a suite of
            PowerShell cmdlets and a set of Cross-Platform Command Line Interface (xplat-cli) commands, both of which
            allow for easy scripting; the xplat-cli runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows, while PowerShell runs only on
            Windows. Visual Studio and third-party tools can also integrate by using the APIs. You can also create
            custom integrations as needed. 12 Creating Microsoft Azure Web Sites Simplicity is a feature Powerful
            features are helpful only for sites that need them—now or in the future. However, if you run a small lab,
            you probably don’t need custom integration or Internet-scale features; you may not even have the resources
            to maintain your own web site. With Microsoft Azure, once your web site is running, you can forget about it.
            If the web site fails or crashes, it restarts automatically—no manual intervention required. You have a
            simple view, including monitoring and management, directly from the Microsoft Azure Management Portal. Learn
