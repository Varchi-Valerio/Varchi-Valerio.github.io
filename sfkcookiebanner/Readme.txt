[FREE MODULE] Prestashop cookie consent banner for version 1.6/1.7/8.0

Hi All,

Greetings of the day.

This prestashop addon helps administrators to show interactive notifications regarding cookies used by stores as per EU Cookie Law compliance on bottom positions with a link to redirect the cookie policy page, management from the back-office with multiple options, and show different messages based on multiple store languages.

Cookies allow a website to store and retrieve information about the browsing habits of a user or their computer and can be used to recognize patterns and tastes of the user. The user’s browser saves cookies on the hard drive only during the current session occupying a minimum memory space and without harming the performance of the user’s computer. Cookies do not contain any type of specific personal information.

In Europe, every website must show a banner to say that you are using cookies. There are different laws in different countries which means actually this banner must be implemented differently. But in most cases, it is enough to have just a banner that the user can close and won't see anymore after the page reload.

Cookies enable websites to gather data about visitors and users. Cookies let websites remember you, your website logins, shopping carts, and more.

This module helps to show different language information based on store language. For example, the German language store will have messages in German, and the French language store will have messages in French.

The Cookie Law is a piece of privacy legislation that requires websites to get consent from visitors to store or retrieve any information on a computer, Smartphone, or tablet.
It started as an EU Directive that was adopted by all EU countries in May 2011.
If you own a website, you will need to make sure it complies with the law.

This module is a light, elegant and powerful solution that allows your shop to comply with the European cookie law by informing users that your site has cookies, with a link for more information and understanding customer messages in their own language.
